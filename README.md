### Machine Learning

* #### [Deep learning](https://github.com/WesleyyC/Read-Love-Pray/blob/master/deep-learning.pdf)

  This is a review paper by Yan LeCun et cl and it gives a good general picture about deep learning. In my opinion, what a wikipedia page should look like after the summary section.
  
* #### [Dropout](https://github.com/WesleyyC/Read-Love-Pray/blob/master/dropout.pdf)

  Regularization is a very important component in machine learning. This paper in particular, talks about the regularization challenge in deep learning. While deep learning in some way mimic human's brain strucutre with layers of process, it does not provide the flexibility in structure as human brain do. This paper describes a simple way to create a robust deep learning model that allow some of the "neurons" turn down during the reading. What is particularly beautiful about this paper is that it starts with a biology motivation and end with a great mathmatical solution for machine learning.
  
* #### [Go Game and Deep Learning](https://github.com/WesleyyC/Read-Love-Pray/blob/master/mastering-the-game-of-Go-with-deep-neural-networks-and-tree-search.pdf)

  This is a very high profile paper. While the concepts in the paper are not new, the way Deepmind teams put them together is an engineering gem. Plus, it is a interesting challenge as Go is not an easy game...
